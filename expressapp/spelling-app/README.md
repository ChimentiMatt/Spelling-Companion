# Spelling Companion

Improve your spelling by having your misspelled words collected and provided to you. Learn instead of relying on auto-correcting, and right-fixing your errors.  Spend a few minutes here and there and finally improve. 

## Discover your Problem Words

As you use the app, it stores information on words you misspelled. This allows you to have a directory to study and improve. You can also put words in manually.

It works by giving you the word verbally as well as giving you the definition. IF you can spell it correctly, the word is ignored, else it is stored for further education

## Improve your Spelling

Review the words you misspelled and test yourself on your progress. You can also do flashcards to improve.

## Perfect for Teachers or Anyone Wanting to Improve

Since the app saves your misspellings, it is a perfect learning tool to use as a habit. Log in, study your words, take the spelling test, no matter what, improve. It is easy, simple and it works.
